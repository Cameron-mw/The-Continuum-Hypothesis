Paper: The Continuum Hypothesis and Interpretations in the Philosophy of Mathematics - LaTeX
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) was the first of 23 unsolved problems collected and proposed by David Hilbert to be the most important and influential problems of mathematics in the 20th century. 
The Continuum Hypothesis is a simple statement that there does not exist a set whose cardinality is between that of the natural numbers and the real numbers. 
This question of the continuum has existed since Georg Cantor formalized many of the ideas of set theory used today, and the intrigue surrounding the hypothesis has continued to this day as well. 
A formal proof eluded mathematicians until Kurt Gödel's and Paul Cohen’s proofs in the mid 20th century collectively showed that the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC set theory, meanum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC set theory, meaniing that ZFC is consistent with CH as an axiom or $\neg$CH as an axiom. 
While the independence of CH is firmly established, further investigation into CH's relationship with set theory is ongoing today.
